# Python-Project-JARVIS-Voice-Assistant-
A simple Python-based voice assistant inspired by JARVIS that can perform a variety of tasks using voice commands.

Features
Play YouTube videos: Just say "Play [song/video name]" and it will open the video on YouTube.
Tell the current time: Ask "What time is it?" to get the current time.
Provide today's date: Get the current date with "What is today's date?"
Wikipedia summaries: Ask "Who is [person's name]?" to receive a quick summary from Wikipedia.
Casual conversation: Handles basic interactions like "How are you?" or "What's your name?".
How It Works
Listens for commands using the speech_recognition library.
Processes commands with a recognizer and performs actions based on keywords.
Uses text-to-speech (pyttsx3) for spoken responses.
